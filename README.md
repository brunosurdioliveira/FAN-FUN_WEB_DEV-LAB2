1. IWD Students have decided to run their own airline that will fly students between all the Fanshawe campus’. There will be a limited number of flights and seats. Your web page will collect information; then determine the number of flights needed based on the number of passengers and the number of available seats in the flights to determine the number of passengers that can travel using the airline.
Display a pop-up message box showing the following greeting: “Welcome to The IWD Airline!”
2. Prompt the user for the following information:
Number of passengers on waitlist: Number of seats on each flight: Slogan of the airline:
default is “343”
default is “117”
default is “Unlocking Potential”
3. Calculate the number of flights required (e.g. passengers / seats).
4. IWD Airlines will not schedule a flight if it is less than half-filled. Round the number of flights up or down to return the correct integer value.
5. Calculate the seats available (e.g. flights * seats).
6. Check if the number of passengers on the waiting list is greater than the seats available and, if so, then calculate the number of passengers that will remain on the waiting list.
7. Output the number of passengers on the waiting list, the number of available seats, and the number of flights required for the day.
8. If there are passengers remaining on the waiting list; output the number of passengers that may fly and the number of passengers that will remain on the waiting list. Otherwise, output that all passengers will fly today.
9. Output “Thank you for flying with IWD Airlines: ” with the slogan. See the sample inputs and outputs.
